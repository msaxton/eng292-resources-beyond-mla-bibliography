## Primary sources and secondary sources
* What is a primary source?
* What is a secondary source?

Why do we make this distinction?


## Finding the right database(s) for you
There is no one perfect database

* Do I need primary sources or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need? (Critical edition, newspaper, or something else?)
* Do I need a primary source from a particular time period or location?
* Do I need a book or an article?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus?

### Example databases
* [Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO)](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=RsrcRcrdECCO)
* [HathiTrust Digital Library](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HathiTr)
* [William Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/)
* [JSTOR](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=JSTOR)
* [Historical Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HistAbs)


## Finding the right sources for you
Pro tip: Combine keyword searching with subject terms

What is keyword searching?  
What are subject terms?

### Example
Searching for sources on "Romanticism" and "Slavery" in [JumboSearch](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0&sortby=rank)

### How do I find subject terms?
* Check the bibliographic record for good results from keyword searching.
* Look for a "Subjects" or "Thesaurus" tab on databases.
* Consult the course guide.



## Brief Workshop
* Browse the list of databases on the [Course Guide](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/reading-romanticism).
* Select a database of interest and make a note of why you have selected this particular database.
* Begin searching with keywords.
* After browsing search results, see if you can add any subject terms to narrow your results.
* Be sure to write down what search terms you use with each database.
